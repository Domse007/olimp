#+Title: Opinionated Lisp IMPlementation

Olimp is a basic Lisp implementation that compiles into a custom byte
format. The compiled program is simultaneously the compiler and the
interpreter.

I wanted to keep this implementation dependency free. Mostly because
of curiosity how much can be achieved with the std library.

* Building
This project uses the standard cargo way of compiling.

#+begin_src sh
$ git clone https://www.github.com/domse007/olimp
$ cargo build --release
#+end_src

After that the resulting binary can be found in the =target/release/=
directory.
